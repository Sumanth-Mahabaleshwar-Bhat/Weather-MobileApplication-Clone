# Weather Mobile Application Clone

Creating a weather application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific location. The app will display the temperature, weather icon, and a brief description of the weather (e.g., "Sunny," "Cloudy," "Rainy").

I have created a user-friendly interface to display hourly weather information for New York, USA. The app provides detailed weather data for each hour, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and more. The app opens to a beautiful home screen featuring a list of hourly weather updates. Each entry displays the time, temperature, weather icon, and additional details. At the top of the screen, there is a back arrow icon and the title consists of "New York, USA" and "Hourly Weather" for location information.

Each entry provides the following information:
Time: Displays the hour of the day (e.g., "11:00 AM").
Temperature: Shows the current temperature in Celsius (e.g., "18°C").
Weather Icon: An icon representing the weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy).
Date: Provides the current date in the format "dd/MM/yyyy".
Humidity: The humidity level expressed as a percentage (e.g., "44%").
Precipitation: Amount of precipitation in millimeters (e.g., "0 mm").
Wind Chill: Wind chill factor in Celsius (e.g., "3°C").
Wind Speed: Wind speed in kilometers per hour (e.g., "12 km/h").
Dew Point: Dew point temperature in Celsius (e.g., "-6°C").
Cloud Cover: Cloud coverage percentage (e.g., "18%").
Pressure: Atmospheric pressure in millibars (e.g., "1016mbar").
Wind Direction: Wind direction (e.g., "West North").
